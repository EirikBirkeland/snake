# Pong

This is my first take on the classic Pong.
I enthusiastically built this in order to get an idea of what it means to actually make a video game from scratch using HTML5 canvas, without any game libraries.

The primary challenge was implementing proper collision detection.

This game is really easy to re-create. I recommend anyone to implement this from scratch as their first video game. Using basic concepts, you should be able to implement Pong in no time!

Notice the subtle and intriguing bugs stemming from poor collision detection.
